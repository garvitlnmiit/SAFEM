What Is SAFEM?
--------------

Student and Faculty Evaluation Module(SAFEM) is the web-based application
(written using JavaServlets, HTML, CSS and JavaScript) part of the 
campus automation project. This application aims to automate the process
of evaluation of students and faculty in an institute/organization.

For the complete understanding of this software it is required to see the
documentations.

How to Use/Contribute?
----------------------

To put the application on work you need to first have apache tomcat 
server (v6.0) which you can get from (http://tomcat.apache.org/). 
Configure it with the mysql server the way you want. Now if you are
done with the apache tomcat server configuration, replace the ROOT 
directory of the apache server with the ROOT directory placed over 
here. Note you may have to change some lines of the 
ROOT/WEB-INF/context.xml and ROOT/WEB-INF/web.xml.

Now, create a new database "swe" and import the DemoDB.sql to initialize
your database with the dummy values.

If everything had configured correctly then you will be able to see
the login page at (localhost:8080).
