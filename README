What Is SAFEM?
--------------

Student and Faculty Evaluation Module(SAFEM) is the web-based application
(written using JavaServlets, HTML, CSS and JavaScript) part of the 
campus automation project. This application aims to automate the process
of evaluation of students and faculty in an institute/organization.

For the complete understanding of this software it is required to see the
documentations.

How to Use/Contribute?
----------------------

To put the application on work you need to first have apache tomcat server 
which you can get from (http://tomcat.apache.org/). Configure it with the
mysql server the way you want. Now if you are done with the apache tomcat 
server configuration then replace the ROOT directory of the apache server
with the ROOT directory placed over here. Note you may have to change some
lines of the ROOT/WEB-INF/context.xml and ROOT/WEB-INF/web.xml.

Do not forget to use the DemoDB.sql to initialize your database with the 
dummy values.

If all the things had configured correctly then you would be able to see
the login page at (localhost:8080).
